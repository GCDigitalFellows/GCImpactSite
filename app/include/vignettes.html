            <p>Professor Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s book, Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis and Opposition in Globalizing California exposed the political and economic forces in California prisons. Her research and advocacy resulted in lasting improvements in prisoners’ conditions and the California criminal justice system. Through her anti-racist, anti-sexist research agenda she has made immeasurable contributions to society. In the 2012 DVD “Visions of Abolition: From Critical Resistance to a New Way of Life,” Gilmore joins other scholars to examine the prison system and the history of the prison abolition movement. She is currently working on a second edition of Golden Gulag.</p>

            <p>In her 2013 dissertation, Rowena Kennedy-Epstein discovered and published poet Muriel Rukeyser’s only novel, Savage Coast. She discovered this novel among a box of miscellany, long since forgotten; in it, Rukeyser exposes her life-long interest in Spain and the Spanish Civil War. Contextualizing this piece within Rukeyser’s overall work, Kennedy-Epstein helps us understand both Rukeyser and the socio-political climate that excluded female authors throughout 20th century.</p>

These findings were used by a Texas judge to overturn a highly restrictive law in that imposed significant barriers on women seeking reproductive health services, and would have severely restricted access to affordable reproductive health care.</p>

            <p>Zeinab Chahine, head of the New York City Office of Casey Family Programs, found in her 2014 dissertation that subtle changes in institutional approaches to child maltreatment reports have led to an overall decline in the number of children who enter foster care. Her research shows that by focusing on strengthening the entire family unit rather than isolating the child maltreatment, more families are able to stay together, and children are kept out of foster care.</p>

            <p>Amy Castro Baker’s 2014 dissertation is a powerful exposition of how the subprime mortgage markets that characterized the 2008 economic crisis disproportionately affected women. By bringing together social welfare research, market economy history, demographic data, and personal interviews, Baker uncovers a startling sequence of events and social forces that have put women at disproportionately high risk for personal financial crisis. Her research has paved the way for increased protections for women and other financially at-risk groups.</p>

Through his committed research and activism, he has connected Latino communities in NYC and Philadelphia with policy makers, scholars, and education personnel as they collectively shape education and the future of the neighborhoods they live and work in.</p>
